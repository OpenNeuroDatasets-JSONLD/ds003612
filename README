STUDY DESCRIPTION:
To  the best of our knowledge there is no study directly investigating the difference between right and left handers MI neural correlates per se and especially in the cerebellum. To achieve a deeper understanding of handedness effects on motor imagery in both right and left-handed individuals, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare neural correlates associated with the execution and imagination of a simple task (i.e., squeezing a ball) with the dominant, non-dominant and both hands. 


DATASET DESCRIPTION:

- participants.tsv: document with the information reagarding sex, age, handedness, and questionnaires results of all the 51 subjects included.
